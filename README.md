this is a simple tic tac toe game

it verifies rows columns and diagonal on a grid built by functions, 
it has two players alternate in making selections, via the numberpad so long as the selections are valid (i.e. numbers from 1-9)
it also verifies if positions have been occupied by previous selections and when necessary prompts the players to retry
it runs off of a while loop with a limit of 9 iterations due to that being the max number of spaces one can utilize in a single game

i used a video by user Garret Halstein as the basis for the logic of the program, due to the surprising complexity of the rules at work.
